# XGENO.DBHelpers

XGENO.DBHelpers is a simple, easy-to-use and powerful OR Mapper for your database queries. It is set of extension methods (on the SQL Connection), which execute a SQL query (simple, parameterized, stored procs etc.) and return the data as a list of .NET objects (POCO classes that you have created).
